    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a student at Maharaja Institute of Technology, currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication. I am passionate about Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking and am always looking for new ways to grow and learn.
        In my time at Maharaja Institute of Technology, I have been involved in a number of Hacking events that were held in other institutions around Mysore and have gained experience in this field. I am also a member of IETE and have participated in Hackathon and Hackerupt events to stay up to date on the latest trends and developments in my field.
        As I near the end of my studies, I am eager to start my career and put my skills to use in the IT industry.
